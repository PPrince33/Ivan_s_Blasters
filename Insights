## Analysis of Pythagorean Expectation vs. Actual Win%

The Pythagorean expectation is a key metric used in sports analytics to predict the winning percentage expected based on the number of goals scored and conceded. Here’s how Kerala Blasters performed in comparison to their Pythagorean expectation:

* 2021-22 Season: The Pythagorean expectation was 0.67, suggesting that based on their goals scored and conceded, the team should have won about 67% of their matches. However, their actual win rate was lower at 45%. This discrepancy indicates that the team underperformed relative to their statistical potential, possibly due to inefficiencies in converting goal opportunities or defensive vulnerabilities.
* 2022-23 Season: This season saw the team’s Pythagorean expectation aligning more closely with their actual win percentage, both at around 50%. This suggests that the team performed largely in line with what would be expected based on their goals for and against.
* 2023-24 Season: Again, there was a gap between the Pythagorean expectation (0.52) and the actual win rate (0.45), indicating a slight underperformance. Similar to the 2021-22 season, this could point to challenges in game management, strategy execution, or other factors that prevented the team from achieving their theoretical performance level.
